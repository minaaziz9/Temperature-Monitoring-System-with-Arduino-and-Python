# Temperature-Monitoring-System-with-Arduino-and-Python
This project uses an Arduino to collect temperature data from a sensor and sends it to a Python script for visualization and logging.


Designed and implemented a temperature monitoring system using Arduino and Python for real-time data collection and visualization.
Secured communication via serial protocols and processed data using Python libraries like Matplotlib.
